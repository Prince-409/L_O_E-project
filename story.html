            <h2>The First Thought</h2>
            <p>
                I don’t remember the exact day,  
                but I remember the feeling…  
                when your name started appearing in my mind  
                without any reason — and staying there.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="moment reveal">
            <h2>The First Smile</h2>
            <p>
                Your smile had something special, Isha.  
                It wasn’t loud, it wasn’t dramatic —  
                it was calm, warm, and somehow  
                it felt like home.

        <div class="moment reveal">
            <h2>The Moment I Fell</h2>
            <p>
                I didn’t fall in love suddenly.  
                I fell slowly — in conversations,  
                in silences, in small moments…  
                until one day I realized  
                my heart had already chosen you.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="moment reveal">
            <h2>You Became My Safe Place</h2>
            <p>
                In a noisy world,  
                you became my calm.  
                In confusing days,  
                you became my clarity.  
                With you, everything feels a little lighter.
            </p>

            <h2>And This Is Just The Beginning</h2>
            <p>
                This story doesn’t end here.  
                This is just a chapter —  
                a small one —  
                in a book I want to keep writing  
                with you, Isha… always 💕
